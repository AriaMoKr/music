// The shared session (SPEC §5.6 "Together"): the Hallway's (AriaMoKr/layersharedsession, peer to
// peer over WebRTC with Trystero, through public Nostr relays; common's README, "Going in"). Its
// room is in the address (?room=), so the address is the invitation: the Hallway's door brings it
// here, and the way back carries it on (main.js, common's leaveUrl), so the visitor stays in it.
// This page is its door's id in the session (together-space.js PAGE_ID).
//
// The layer's controller (together.js, createTogether) runs it: joining and leaving, stepping out
// for the door and back, the room in the address, this visitor's pose and the others' avatars
// (a head with a visor on its front, a hand per tracked controller, a ring on the floor and their
// name), loading the session module and Trystero only when a session is joined. What is the
// library's own stays here: where in the library each visitor is (together-space.js: each place
// and room is laid out on its own), so only those in the same room are drawn and counted here,
// and the words (noticeText). The vendor modules are named by relative URL (server/vendor.js
// rewrites their bare imports, and the Pages build copies them).
